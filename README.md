<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Cheatsheet

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

There are many Python Tkinter Cheatsheets available on internet, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this  one. I wanted to create a cheatsheet so amazing that'll be containing every important command you ever need.

Here's why:
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like revisiting long and boring documentations for refering the commands.
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others.



A list of commonly used resources that I myself followed and find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Technologies Used
`Python Modules ->`
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html)
